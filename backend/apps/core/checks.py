"""Custom system checks for defects Django's own checks do not catch.

Django validates a ``ModelAdmin``'s ``fields``/``fieldsets`` only partially, and
``InlineModelAdmin.fields`` escapes that validation entirely: naming a field
that does not exist on the inline's model passes ``manage.py check`` cleanly and
only fails at request time, with a 500 on the change page.

This module closes that gap by actually constructing every registered admin
form and inline formset at check time — the same operation the admin performs
when rendering — so the failure surfaces before the process serves traffic.
